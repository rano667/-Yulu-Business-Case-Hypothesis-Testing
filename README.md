# üö≤ Yulu Business Case: Hypothesis Testing

This project focuses on analyzing rental patterns of electric bicycles (like Yulu) to evaluate business hypotheses using statistical testing methods. The objective is to determine whether there is a significant difference in the number of electric cycles rented on working days versus non-working days.

---

## üìä Problem Statement

**Business Question:**  
_Is there a significant difference in Yulu bike rentals between working days and non-working days?_

To answer this, hypothesis testing was conducted on historical rental data using a two-sample t-test approach.

## üìÅ Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `datetime`: Timestamp of rental
- `season`, `holiday`, `workingday`, `weather`: Categorical descriptors
- `temp`, `atemp`, `humidity`, `windspeed`: Environmental conditions
- `casual`, `registered`, `count`: Number of rentals

---

## üìå Key Steps in the Analysis

- Load and explore the dataset
- Group records by working vs. non-working days
- Check for normality and equal variances
- Perform independent two-sample t-test
- Interpret the p-value and conclude

---

## üìà Result Summary

- **P-value**: 0.2264
- **Conclusion**: Since the p-value is greater than the alpha level (0.05), we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.
- **Interpretation**: There is **no statistically significant difference** in electric bike rentals between working days and non-working days.
